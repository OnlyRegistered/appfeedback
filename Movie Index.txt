Movie Index - Overview

Your Movie Database Creator! Create your own Movie database using the video files stored on your computer and share it online within a VPN private network or local network with family and friends. Supported video formats include: .mp3, .mp4, .webm, .aac, .ogg, .opus, .wav, .m4a, .3gp, .aiff, .au, and .amr. If your browser does not support certain formats, those files will be automatically downloaded, allowing you to play them with another player, such as VLC. If you have VLC Player and VLC playlists, you can download and play them directly from Movie Index as well.

Additionally, if you save an image in formats like .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, .webp, or .bmp with the same name as your video file, that image will be displayed alongside the video file. The HTML structure is organized similarly to your directory structure on your hard drive, and you have the option to hide specific directories. By renaming a directory with the extension _no order _private, it will be excluded from the system and not listed. Each time you launch Movie Index, you can specify your drive, and your HTML network will be created. Any changes made to your directory structure or Movie files will be updated automatically upon startup. The search function is designed to yield more results the fewer characters you enter.


If you decide to stop using Movie Index, you can utilize the CleanIndex option to delete the entire HTML structure you created, leaving no remnants behind.


Installation Instructions

   Download the MovieIndex Package
   Download the packaged MovieIndex.rar file.
   Extract the Files
   Unpack it using a RAR extraction tool.
   Install the Program
   Run MovieIndex Installer.exe with administrator rights.

If you run the program via the shortcut and it opens after your entry, then close it without showing any errors.

There is an error with the administrator rights, please go to the installation directory "C:\Program Files (x86)\Movie Index\ and set administrator rights to CleanIndex.exe, CleanUP.exe and Movie Index.exe.

Running the Program

As Movie Index Server:

   Double-click on the "Movie Index Server" icon, or use the shortcut from the Windows Start menu or your desktop to launch the program.

   Enter your VPN or local host IP address and press Enter.

   Then, enter your working directory where you want to create the Movie index. (Note: Movie files are only read in the sub directories of the main directory. So, if D:\ is the main directory, all Movie files located in sub directories of D:\ will be read and included.)

   This will open Movie Index in your browser, enabling seamless interaction.

As Movie Index Visitors:

   Double-click on the "Movie Index Visitors" icon, or use the shortcut from the Windows Start menu or your desktop to launch the program.

   Enter the VPN or localhost IP address provided by the Host-User and press Enter.

   This will open Movie Index in your browser, allowing for seamless interaction as well.

As Movie Index CleanUp:

   Double-click on the "Movie Index CleanUp" icon, or use the shortcut from the Windows Start menu to launch the program.

   A prompt will appear: "Do you want to clean up the Movie Index immediately? (Y/N)"

   If you choose "No," the CleanIndex-Server will start after 20 seconds. You can then start the process from Movie Index.

   Press Y for Yes or N for No. The cleanup process can be used on Movie Index as a host user only. CleanUp always uses the last directory path you used to create the Movie Index.


VLC Playlists

How it works, first this function is possible as host user!

Your own VLC Playlists, create a VLC Playlist with the VLC Player in your movie series directory. This function was created in case you want to watch several movies in a row, or several episodes of a TV series.

The second good thing is if you have movies or TV series on another drive that are not included in Movie Index. You can create a VLC playlist there and then copy this playlist into the directory .My VLC PlayLists, which was created by Movie Index. So copy it here. If you want an image, give the image the same name as your VLC Playlist file and Movie Index will include this image.

At the Movie Index webpage click on the buttom in /.My VLC PlayLists html then the Playlist on this page. A download will open, click on the download file in the browser and the VLC Player will play your VLC Playlists.

After 20 seconds, the downloaded file will be deleted from user downloads.

(All files with the extension .xspf) (If you are not quick enough, you will have to repeat this process. Only as Host User!)

There is a way to make the VLC Playlist playable for the remote user. But only for VLV PlayList createt in the Movie Index directory. Share the drive on which you create the movie index in the local network. The remote user has to map this shared device with the same drive letter as the host user. Then he will be able to play the VLC Playlists as they now have the same path for the files as the host user.

Enjoy your online Movie Index experience with your new Movie Database Creator!
