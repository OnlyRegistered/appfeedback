Image Index - Overview

Your Image Database Creator! Create your own Image database using the image files stored on your computer and share it online within a VPN private network or local network with family and friends. Supported image formats include: .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, .webp, .bmp, .tiff, .pst, .pdf, .raw, .eps, .ai, .indd, .dwg. If your browser does not support certain formats, those files will be automatically downloaded, allowing you to play them with another player, such as VLC. If you have VLC Player and VLC playlists, you can download and play them directly from Image Index as well.

Additionally, if you save an image in formats like .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, .webp, or .bmp with the same name as your image file, that image will be displayed alongside the image file. The HTML structure is organized similarly to your directory structure on your hard drive, and you have the option to hide specific directories. By renaming a directory with the extension _no order _private, it will be excluded from the system and not listed. Each time you launch Image Index, you can specify your drive, and your HTML network will be created. Any changes made to your directory structure or Image files will be updated automatically upon startup. The search function is designed to yield more results the fewer characters you enter.

If you decide to stop using Image Index, you can utilize the CleanIndex option to delete the entire HTML structure you created, leaving no remnants behind.

Installation Instructions

    Download the ImageIndex Package
    Download the packaged ImageIndex.rar file.

    Extract the Files
    Unpack it using a RAR extraction tool.

    Install the Program
    Run ImageIndex Installer.exe with administrator rights.
If you run the program via the shortcut and it opens after your entry, then close it without showing any errors.
There is an error with the administrator rights, please go to the installation directory "C:\Program Files (x86)\Image Index\ and set administrator rights to CleanIndex.exe, CleanUP.exe and Image Index.exe.

Running the Program

    Double-click on the "Image Index Server" icon, or use the shortcut from the Windows Start menu or your desktop to launch the program.
    Enter your VPN or localhost IP address and press Enter.
    Then, enter your working directory where you want to create the Image index. (Note: Image files are only read in the subdirectories of the main directory. So, if D:\ is the main directory, all Image files located in subdirectories of D:\ will be read and included.)
    This will open Image Index in your browser, enabling seamless interaction.

As Image Index Visitors:

    Double-click on the "Image Index Visitors" icon, or use the shortcut from the Windows Start menu or your desktop to launch the program.
    Enter the VPN or localhost IP address provided by the Host-User and press Enter.
    This will open Image Index in your browser, allowing for seamless interaction as well.

As Image Index CleanUp:

    Double-click on the "Image Index CleanUp" icon, or use the shortcut from the Windows Start menu to launch the program.
    A prompt will appear: "Do you want to clean up the Image Index immediately? (Y/N)"
    If you choose "No," the CleanIndex-Server will start after 20 seconds. You can then start the process from Image Index.
    Press Y for Yes or N for No. The cleanup process can be used on Image Index as a host user only. CleanUp always uses the last directory path you used to create the Image Index.
