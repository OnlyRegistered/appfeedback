        <h2>Music Index</h2>
        <p>Music Index: Your HTML Music Database Creator!
            Create your own music database using the audio files stored on your computer and share it online within the RadminVPN private network with family and friends.
            Supported audio formats include: .mp3, .mp4, .webm, .aac, .ogg, .opus, .wav, .m4a, .3gp, .aiff, .au, .amr.
            If your browser does not support certain formats, those files will be automatically downloaded, allowing you to play them with another player, such as VLC.
            If you have VLC player and VLC playlists, you can download and play them directly from Music Index as well.
            Additionally, if you save an image in formats like .jpg, .png, or .gif with the same name as your audio file, that image will be displayed alongside the audio file.
            The HTML structure is organized similarly to your directory structure on your hard drive, and you have the option to hide specific directories. By renaming a directory with the extension _no order _private, it will be excluded from the system and not listed.
            Each time you launch Music Index, you can specify your drive, and your HTML network will be created. Any changes made to your directory structure or music files will be updated automatically upon startup.
            The search function is designed to yield more results the fewer characters you enter.
            If you decide to stop using it, you can utilize the CleanHardDrive option to delete the entire HTML structure you created, leaving no remnants behind.
            Give it a try and let us know what you think!</p>
