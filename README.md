# Our Software Development and Projects

**[Projects Downloads](https://onlyregistered.itch.io/)**

We are a small group of passionate developers dedicated to creating free software products.

You can access our public repository. Under the "Main" section, navigate to "Software Downloads," where you will find our projects along with their descriptions.

All of our projects are currently designed exclusively for MS Windows; however, we plan to expand this in the future. The applications can be installed using the `install.exe` file, and they are packaged as downloadable `.rar` files.

## Projects

1. **PC Tools**  
   Small, miscellaneous programs that make everyday tasks easier. Examples include tools to:
   - Change the file extensions of multiple files at once.
   - Rename images in bulk.
   - Rename upper to lower case for file extensions, and more.

2. **FileFinderTool**  
   A program that searches your hard drive or specific locations to find duplicate files for deletion. You can also search by file extension.

3. **CleanHardDrive**  
   A tool to clean up specific files in your system that you no longer need. Specify the file types and locations to search, and the program will help you reclaim space by removing unnecessary files.

4. **Image Index**  
   An HTML creator that searches a specified directory for image files and generates an HTML page that can be shared with family and friends. You'll rediscover old photos you may have forgotten about.

5. **Music Index**  
   An HTML creator that scans for audio files (like .mp3 and .mp4) and builds a music library that can be accessed online. Share the HTML page with friends and family to let them stream your music. Also includes a cleaning feature to tidy up HTML and restore the system to its original state.

6. **Movie Index**  
   A program similar to Music Index, but for video files. It creates an HTML page to serve your movies and videos online, so you can stream them with your friends and family. Also includes a cleaning system for easy maintenance.

7. **Simple Video Conference**  
   A video conferencing tool without the advertising and restrictions found in platforms like Skype and Zoom. Connect with up to 6 people for video calls, chats, and file sharing, without needing to answer calls manually. It can also double as a security camera for your home.
