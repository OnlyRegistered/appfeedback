Music Index - Overview

    Description: Music Index is your personal music database creator! Create your own music database using the audio files stored on your computer and share it online within a VPN private network or local network with family and friends.

    Supported Formats: .mp3, .mp4, .webm, .aac, .ogg, .opus, .wav, .m4a, .3gp, .aiff, .au, and .amr. If your browser does not support certain formats, those files will be automatically downloaded, allowing you to play them with another player, such as VLC. If you have VLC Player and VLC playlists, you can download and play them directly from Music Index as well.

    Additional Features:
        If you save an image in formats like .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, .webp, or .bmp with the same name as your audio file, that image will be displayed alongside the audio file.
        The HTML structure mirrors your hard drive's directory structure.
        You can hide specific directories by renaming them with the extension "_no order _private". These directories will be excluded.
        Each time you launch Music Index, you can specify your drive, and your HTML network is created/updated. Changes to your directory structure or music files are automatically reflected upon startup.
        The search function provides more results with fewer characters entered.
        A list of your networks will be displayed. With a WebSocket extension for your internet browser, you can send messages to the server and all clients.
        Use the CleanIndex option to completely remove the created HTML structure when you stop using Music Index.
        You can easily change the styles.css, background.mp4, and all sound output to your liking.

Installation Instructions

    Download: Download the MusicIndex Package (MusicIndex.rar).
    Extract: Unpack the .rar file using a RAR extraction tool.
    Install: Run MusicIndex Installer.exe with administrator rights. If the program closes immediately after opening via the shortcut, manually set administrator rights for CleanIndex.exe, CleanUP.exe, and Music Index.exe in the installation directory ("C:\Program Files (x86)\Music Index").

Running the Program

    Music Index Server (Host):
        Double-click the "Music Index Server" icon, or use the shortcut.
        Enter your VPN or localhost IP address and press Enter.
        Enter the working directory where you want to create the music index. (Note: music files are only read in the subdirectories of the main directory. So, if D:\ is the main directory, all music files located in subdirectories of D:\ will be included.)
        This will open Music Index in your browser, enabling seamless interaction.

    Music Index Visitors:
        Double-click the "Music Index Visitors" icon, or use the shortcut.
        Enter the VPN or localhost IP address provided by the Host-User and press Enter.
        This will open Music Index in your browser, allowing for seamless interaction as well.

    Music Index CleanUp:
        Double-click the "Music Index CleanUp" icon, or use the shortcut.
        A prompt will appear: "Do you want to clean up the Music Index immediately? (Y/N)"
        If you choose "No," the CleanIndex-Server will start after 20 seconds. You can then start the process from Music Index.
        Press Y for Yes or N for No. The cleanup process can be used on Music Index as a host user only. CleanUp always uses the last directory path you used to create the Music Index.

Creating and Playing Playlists

If you have created your own music playlists, for example, with VLC Player, you can play them in Music Index.

    Press the "Browse" button and add your playlist.xspf.
    Then, press the "Upload your VLC Playlist" button.
    You will see a download in your browser as soon as it has finished loading (2-4 seconds).
    Click on this file in the browser to start playing the playlist. This playlist file is not needed; it only serves as a starting point and will be deleted from your download directory after 10 seconds. (If you are not quick enough, you will have to repeat this process.)
