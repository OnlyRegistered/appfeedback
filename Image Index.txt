Image Index - Overview

Description: Image Index is your personal image database creator! Organize and share image files from your computer within a VPN, private network, or local network.

Supported Formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, .webp, .bmp, .tiff, .pst, .pdf, .raw, .eps, .ai, .indd, .dwg. Unsupported formats will automatically download, allowing you to view them with external App's.

Additional Features:
If you save a thumbnail image (in .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, .webp, or .bmp format) with the same name as your image file, it will be displayed alongside the original.
The HTML structure mirrors your hard drive's directory structure.
You can hide specific directories by renaming them with the extension "_no order _private". These directories will be excluded.
Each time you launch Image Index, you specify your drive, and your HTML network is created/updated. Changes to your directory structure or image files are automatically reflected on startup.
The search function provides more results with fewer characters entered.
A list of your networks will be displayed. With a WebSocket extension for your internet browser, you can send messages to the server and all clients.
Use the CleanIndex option to completely remove the created HTML structure when you stop using Image Index.
You can easily change the styles.css, background.mp4, and all sound output to your liking.

Installation Instructions

Download: Download the ImageIndex Package (ImageIndex.rar).
Extract: Unpack the .rar file using a RAR extraction tool.
Install: Run ImageIndex Installer.exe with administrator rights. If the program closes immediately after opening via the shortcut, manually set administrator rights for CleanIndex.exe, CleanUP.exe, and Image Index.exe in the installation directory ("C:\Program Files (x86)\Image Index").

Running the Program

Image Index Server (Host):
Double-click the "Image Index Server" icon or use the shortcut.
Enter your VPN or localhost IP address and press Enter.
Enter the working directory where you want to create the image index. (Image files are read only from subdirectories of this main directory. For example, if D:\ is the main directory, image files in subdirectories of D:\ will be included.)
Image Index will open in your browser.

Image Index Visitors:
Double-click the "Image Index Visitors" icon or use the shortcut.
Enter the VPN or localhost IP address provided by the Host-User and press Enter.
Image Index will open in your browser.

Image Index CleanUp:
Double-click the "Image Index CleanUp" icon or use the shortcut.
A prompt will appear: "Do you want to clean up the Image Index immediately? (Y/N)"
If you choose "No," the CleanIndex-Server will start after 20 seconds, and you can start the process from Image Index.
Press "Y" for Yes or "N" for No. CleanUp can only be used by the host user and uses the last directory path used to create the Image Index.
