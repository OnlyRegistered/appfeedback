        <h2>PC Tools</h2>
        <p>A collection of small, miscellaneous programs designed to make everyday tasks easier. Examples include tools to:
            Change the file extensions of multiple files at once.
            Rename images in bulk (e.g., from MDAR143.MPG to fell (1).mpg, fell (2).mpg, etc.).
            Convert file names from upper to lower case (e.g., changing .MP3 to .mp3).
            These tools simplify your workflow and enhance your file management experience!

        <h2>Image Index</h2>
        <p>Your Image Database Creator!
            Create your own image database using the image files stored on your computer, and share it online within the RadminVPN private network with family and friends.           
            Supported image formats include: .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, .webp, .bmp, .tiff, .pst, .pdf, .raw, .eps, .ai, .indd, .dwg.         
            Formats that are not supported by your browser will be automatically downloaded.           
            The HTML structure is organized similarly to your directory structure on your hard drive, and you have the option to hide specific directories. By renaming a directory with the extension _no order _private, those directories will be excluded from the system and will not be listed.           
            Each time you launch Image Index, you can specify your drive, and your HTML network will be created. Any changes made to your directory structure or image files will be updated automatically upon startup.           
            The search function is designed to yield more results the fewer characters you enter.         
            If you decide to stop using it, you can use the CleanHardDrive option to delete the entire HTML structure you’ve created, leaving no remnants behind.

        <h2>Music Index</h2>
        <p>Your Music Database Creator!
            Create your own music database using the audio files stored on your computer and share it online within the RadminVPN private network with family and friends.
            Supported audio formats include: .mp3, .mp4, .webm, .aac, .ogg, .opus, .wav, .m4a, .3gp, .aiff, .au, .amr.
            If your browser does not support certain formats, those files will be automatically downloaded, allowing you to play them with another player, such as VLC.
            If you have VLC player and VLC playlists, you can download and play them directly from Music Index as well.
            Additionally, if you save an image in formats like .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, .webp, .bmp with the same name as your audio file, that image will be displayed alongside the audio file.
            The HTML structure is organized similarly to your directory structure on your hard drive, and you have the option to hide specific directories. By renaming a directory with the extension _no order _private, it will be excluded from the system and not listed.
